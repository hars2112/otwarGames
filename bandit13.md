Bandit Level 12 â†’ Level 13
Level Goal
The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt,
 which is a hexdump of a file that has been repeatedly compressed.
 For this level it may be useful to create a directory
 under /tmp in which you can work using mkdir.
 For example: mkdir /tmp/myname123.
 Then copy the datafile using cp, and rename it using mv (read the manpages!)

Commands you may need to solve this level
grep, sort, uniq, strings, base64, tr, tar, gzip, bzip2, xxd, mkdir, cp, mv, file
